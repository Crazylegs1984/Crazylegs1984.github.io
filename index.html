        <h2 id="headline">From young hunter, to federation ambassador. Its a klingon life.....</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>2340</strong> - Worf was born on the Klingon homeworld Qo'noS on May 23. He was named after his grandfather, 
General Worf.</li>
          <li><strong>2346</strong> - The Romulans attack the Khitomer outpost. An infant Worf is rescued from the aftermath by 
Sergei Rozhenko, a Starfleet officer who subsequently adopts him. The Rozhenkos raised Worf on the 
farming colony of Gault and on Earth in Russia and the city of Minsk, with their own son Nikolai 
"Simon" Rozhenko. In his childhood, Worf saved Nikolai from drowning in a river.
</li>
          <li><strong>2353</strong> - While living on Gault, during a tense game of soccer, a crucial play caused Worf and an opponent named Mikel to leap up and 
attempt to hit a high-flying ball with their heads. The two impacted, and force of the impact was 
such that, while Worf did not even feel the hit, Mikel's neck was broken. Mikel died the next day; 
the tragic accident prompted Worf to become very restrained in his behavior and emotional outbursts 
for the rest of his life, mindful of Human frailty.</li>
          <li><strong>2355</strong> - Worf's foster parents arranged for him to stay at his cousins on the Klingon homeworld. He visited the Great Domes of Qo'noS 
and upon gazing at them, he stated that he felt that he had finally came home even if his cousins didn't want to have anything to do with him.</li>
          <li><strong>2357</strong> - Worf enrolled in Starfleet Academy. Upon arriving at the Academy, a Brikar cadet named Zak Kebron picked a fight with Worf 
believing that Klingons had no right to join Starfleet. Rather than expel the two students before they could even report to their first classes, 
the Academy decided to make the pair roommates, forcing them to work out their differences.</li>
          <li><strong>2361</strong> - Worf graduates from Starfleet Academy and begins serving as an ensign aboard the USS Aldrin. Also on the Aldrin were "Dream Team" alumni Soleta and Tania Tobias.
</li>
          <li><strong>2363</strong> - Worf was a part of an away team on the planet Kalandra Minor that was attacked by Romulans. This was the first time Worf had 
encountered the race since his parents' deaths all those years ago, and he did not hesitate to use lethal force against those that he encountered.</li>
          <li><strong>2364</strong> - Worf transferred to the Federation's new flagship, the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D) with the rank of Lieutenant, junior grade under 
the command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard. (TNG episode: "Encounter at Farpoint") Although he had applied for a position in security, 
Picard initially appointed Worf bridge watch officer, whose duty would be to fill in where needed on other stations, reasoning that 
such a role would give Worf important experience for his future career in Starfleet. Worf's life changed quickly aboard the Enterprise. 
In late 2364, he became the ship's Chief of security after the death of the previous position holder, Lieutenant Tasha Yar.</li>
          <li><strong>2365</strong> - Worf was briefly reunited with K'Ehleyr on her mission to prevent a Klingon sleeper IKS T'Ong from attacking lightly defended 
Federation colonies. After the mission, Worf and K'Ehleyr parted ways with Worf saying he would not be complete without her.</li>
          <li><strong>2366</strong> - Worf was promoted to Lieutenant. Later, he was reunited with his brother, Kurn, who was now serving in the Klingon Defense Force. Kurn informed Worf that their father, 
Mogh, was accused of being the traitor that aided the Romulans at Khitomer all those years ago. Mogh's accuser was Duras, son of Ja'rod. 
It was later revealed that Ja'rod himself had been the traitor, and that the Klingon High Council was covering up the truth behind Khitomer 
to protect Duras' politically powerful family, the House of Duras. Worf accepted discommendation to protect the Klingon Empire and prevent a 
civil war. (TNG episode: "Sins of the Father")</li>
          <li><strong>2367</strong> - K'Ehleyr returned with Klingon Chancellor K'mpec who had come to meet with Captain Picard. When she came aboard, Worf learned he had a son named Alexander. 
She wanted to marry him but Worf refused because he did not want to share his dishonor with her and their son (TNG: "Reunion"). After K'mpec's death, she assisted 
Captain Picard with the rite of succession. K'Ehleyr was eventually murdered by Duras when she found evidence of his involvement in the effort to discredit Worf 
(and why he was discommended). Exercising his right of vengeance, Worf fought and killed Duras with a bat'leth in a duel, allowing Duras's political opponent 
Gowron to become chancellor (TNG: "Reunion").</li>
          <li><strong>2369</strong> - while the Enterprise was at Deep Space Nine, Worf investigated a claim that his father might still be alive in a Romulan prison camp. 
His father was not there (having indeed been killed during the battle at Khitomer), but a number of Klingons were living there with the Romulans. 
Unable to return home with honor, as Klingons are supposed to commit suicide rather than be taken prisoner, they stayed and strayed from their way of life. 
Worf's visit had a profound effect on the children of the prisoners and many chose to leave with him (TNG: Birthright).</li>
          <li><strong>2371</strong> -  Worf was promoted to lieutenant commander (Star Trek Generations). After the destruction of the Enterprise-D, Worf took an extended leave to 
evaluate his future. He was at a monastery on the Klingon colony of Boreth when he was ordered to go to Deep Space Nine to advise Captain Sisko 
when a Klingon fleet massed at the station. When he arrived, he was met by former Enterprise-D crew member and Deep Space Nine Chief of Operations 
Miles O'Brien. (DS9: "The Way of the Warrior"). When Worf discovered that the Klingons were planning on attacking Cardassia, Worf relayed this information 
to Sisko. Gowron was willing to forgive Worf for this, but only if he accompanied Gowron for the assault on Cardassia. When Worf refused, Gowron stripped 
his family of land and title, effectively restoring his state of discommendation. Sisko offered Worf the position of station's strategic operations officer, 
coordinating Federation assets throughout the bustling Bajor sector, as well as the position of first officer of the USS Defiant -- a switch to the command track. 
Worf accepted.</li>
          <li><strong>2373</strong> - Worf became involved with DS9 science officer Jadzia Dax, a Trill woman. She was familiar with Klingon customs due to the experience of the Dax symbiont's 
previous host, Curzon. She was the first non-Klingon that Worf could "physically" be with in the traditional Klingon way, although it still left bruises, cuts and broken bones.</li>
          <li><strong>2374</strong> - Worf married Starfleet Lieutenant Commander Jadzia Dax, a Joined Trill; the union lasted until her untimely death in late in December of that year. 
During the war, Worf and Jadzia served together on an important mission to extract a Cardassian defector; when Jadzia's life was endangered, Worf chose 
to save her instead of the defector, earning a major reprimand/permanent demerit due to "dereliction of duty". It was Captain Sisko's opinion the reprimand 
might prevent Worf from ever earning command of his own ship, but that as a man Sisko could not fault Worf for rescuing his wife. On stardate 51604, 
a disciplinary note was entered into Worf's record, stating that he was therefore "ineligible for any further promotion or any permanent command position. 
By late 2374, Worf and Jadzia were married less than a year when they decided to try to have a child, despite the extreme difficulties posed by the 
disparate biologies of Trill and Klingons. While Worf was away during a mission, Jadzia visited the Bajoran temple on the station where she was attacked 
and killed by an alien possessing the body of Gul Dukat, who had come aboard the station to destroy an Orb of the Prophet. (DS9: "Time's Orphan", "Tears of the Prophets")</li>
          <li><strong>2375</strong> - Worf led a mission to destroy a Dominion shipyard. He dedicated this mission to his late wife, 
in order to ensure her entry into Sto-Vo-kor, the Valhalla-like realm of the honored dead, being joined by Quark, 
Bashir and O'Brien (DS9: "Shadows and Symbols").</li>
          <li><strong>2376</strong> - Worf was given temporary command of the Defiant-class USS Avenger, at first to protect the Ba'ku and later to stop Sela in assisting Toral. (ST video game: Armada)</li>
          <li><strong>2377</strong> - Worf was one of the many victims of the Wardens plot to take over the galaxy. Whilst the Klingon High Council, under Warden control, 
prepared to go to war with the Federation, the Wardens kidnapped Worf in an effort to prevent him from defusing the situation. Fortunately, 
the crew of the USS Incursion were at hand and promptly rescued Worf from captivity, delivering him to the Council chambers where he quickly 
moved to dissuade Chancellor Martok from launching the planned attack.</li>
          <li><strong>2385</strong> - After leaving Starfleet and returning to the Klingon homeworld, Worf began a relationship with Grilka. The next year, he married her.</li>
          <li><strong>2387</strong> - Worf accepted a provisional commission in the Klingon Defense Force, and was eventually granted the rank of general. 
He led a task force to stop Nero's quest for vengeance following the destruction of Romulus. The task force was quickly 
overwhelmed and Nero demanded that Worf deliver himself as a captive. Worf agreed, but uses the surrender as cover to 
lead an EVA mission onto Nero's vessel. The Klingons met with initial success, while Worf made his way to the command 
center to find Nero. Worf rejected Nero's attempts to persuade him, and was impaled by the vessel's Borg-enhanced mechanisms. 
Alive but only tenuously, Worf was beamed to the Enterprise as part of a ploy to lower the Starfleet vessel's shields, and was 
immediately transported to sickbay. It took some time for Worf to fully recover from the wounds received onboard the Narada. 
On stardate 65548.43, Grilka gave birth to Worf's second child, a boy named K'Dhan.</li>
          <li><strong>2401</strong> - Worf again became a Federation Ambassador to the Klingon Empire. In that year, he was among a number of retired and 
current Starfleet officers who urged the Federation Council to reconsider their position on the Klingon-Gorn War. 
These veterans argued that the UFP should join the Klingons in fighting the Undine, but the Council was not swayed. 
After the session closed, Worf resigned his position and returned to Qo'noS for the final time, saying that he could 
no longer serve a regime who would willingly endanger its people and that he must follow the path of honor.</li>
          <li><strong>2409</strong> - Worf was often found in the First City, seeing to the business of the House of Martok and assisting young warriors. 
Later, he traveled to New Romulus to act as a liaison between Klingon and Federation forces assisting the Romulan Republic 
with the activation of an Iconian gateway discovered there.</li>
          <li><strong>2410</strong> -  after the defeat of an Undine planet killer over Qo'noS by a joint Federation/Klingon/Romulan fleet, 
Worf was present for the signing of the armistice that ended the Federation-Klingon War of 2405-2410.</li>
